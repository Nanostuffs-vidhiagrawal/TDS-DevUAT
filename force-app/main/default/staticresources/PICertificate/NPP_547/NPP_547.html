                            <p>In the event the Tenant fails to pay the Rent (or any part thereof) within five days of the date on which it fell due and the Landlord or the Letting Agent requires to issue a reminder or reminders, then the Tenant shall pay £60 plus VAT for each month the rent is late in additional to a charge of 8% of the daily rent for each day for part day thereof that the rent remains unpaid, unless prior arrangements have been made with the Landlord. The Tenant shall make payment to the Landlord or the Letting Agent within seven days of request by the Landlord or the Letting Agent. All dishonoured cheques or cancelled standing orders will be charged at £25 plus VAT. The Tenant shall be held liable for any further reasonable costs incurred by the Landlord through the Tenant’s failure to pay rent on time including, but not limited to, any administrative charges or late fees made by the Landlord’s bank, any expenses incurred by the Landlord pursuing the Tenant for payment of said unpaid Rent, legal or otherwise. The aforementioned charges will be deducted from the Deposit unless paid by the Tenant with the outstanding Rent.</p>

                            <h6>11. DEPOSIT</h6>
                            <p>The Landlord must lodge the Deposit they receive with a tenancy deposit scheme within 30 working days of the Start Date of the Tenancy. A tenancy deposit scheme is an independent third-party scheme approved by the Scottish Ministers to hold and protect a deposit until it is due to be repaid. At the Start Date of the Tenancy or before, the Deposit will be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord or the Letting Agent in cleared funds. The Landlord will issue a receipt for the Deposit to the Tenant. No interest shall be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant for the Deposit. The Tenant shall not be entitled to offset any part of the Deposit against any Rent due by him without the Landlord's prior written consent. By law, the deposit amount cannot exceed the equivalent of two months’ Rent and cannot include any premiums. For example, charging for an administration fee or taking a holding fee (regardless of whether or not the holding fee is refundable). Where it is provided in this Agreement that the Tenant is responsible for a particular cost or to do any particular thing and the Tenant fails to meet that cost, or the Landlord carries out work or performs any other obligation for which the Tenant is responsible, the Landlord can apply for reasonable costs to be deducted from the Deposit paid by the Tenant. The Deposit is held as security for the performance of the Tenant’s obligations under this Agreement and to compensate the Landlord for any breach of those obligations. For example, but not limited to, the Deposit may be used by the Landlord to pay for –</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Any Rent arrears, breakages, losses or damage for which the Tenant is liable in terms of this Agreement, the cost of repairing such damage to be assessed by the Landlord or the Letting Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, cost to repair damage occasioned to flooring and/or floor coverings will be deducted from the Deposit and the Tenant is reminded to wear appropriate indoor footwear;</li>
                                <li>All sums in respect of any professional cleaning which may be required, but which the Tenant has failed to do to ensure the Let Property and contents are left in good tenantable order in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the cost of such cleaning to be assessed by the Landlord or the Letting Agent;</li>
                                <li>Any cost incurred in bringing the garden back to an acceptable standard;</li>
                                <li>The cost of keys provided but not returned and/or the cost of replacement of corresponding locks;</li>
                                <li>Any outstanding accounts for Utilities;</li>
                                <li>Any legal fees, VAT and outlays incurred by the Landlord as a result of the Tenant’s breach of this Agreement, including the cost of tribunal proceedings to recover possession of the Let Property;</li>
                                <li>Any costs incurred in carrying out any redecoration work in the Let Property where required due to damage caused by the Tenant and/or due to the Tenant having carried out redecoration work without the prior written consent of the Landlord;</li>
                                <li>Any reasonable costs incurred by the Landlord or properly charged by the Letting Agent during the course of and/or at the end of the tenancy in the preparation of (1) any dilapidations schedule or notices; (2) any cleaning notices; (3) any repairs notices and all reasonable costs incurred by the Landlord or the Letting Agent in enforcing the terms of any such schedule or notices;</li>
                                <li>The sum of £25 plus VAT and/or such other reasonable fees that may be charged to the Landlord by the Letting Agent in respect of the time spent by the Letting Agent calculating, administering and otherwise properly dealing with any deductions that require to be made from the Deposit at the end of the tenancy as a result of the Tenant’s breach of any of their obligations under this Agreement. At the end of the tenancy the Landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme to release the Deposit and the amounts payable to each party. If the Tenant disagrees with the amount, the scheme administrator will provide a dispute resolution mechanism. The Landlord is entitled to transfer the Deposit to a different scheme if he wishes to do so. If he does, the Tenant will be informed of this. At the end of the tenancy the Landlord or the Tenant can ask the scheme to repay the Deposit to them. The scheme will notify the other party and seek their agreement with regards to the disposal of the Deposit. Any proportion of the Deposit which is not in dispute will be paid out by the scheme in accordance with the scheme’s rules. Any proportion of the Deposit in dispute will be held by the scheme pending the outcome of the scheme’s dispute resolution mechanism in accordance with the scheme’s rules. Any dispute regarding the distribution of the Deposit will proceed in accordance with the Tenancy Deposit (Scotland) Regulations 2011. In the event that the Deposit has not yet been transferred to a scheme, at the end of the tenancy, the Deposit, or part of the Deposit will be refunded to the Tenant within 14 days, or as soon as possible after the expiry or termination of this Agreement and all utility bills have been settled by the Tenant. If the Tenant breaches any of the obligations of this Agreement prior to the Deposit being transferred to a tenancy deposit scheme, the Landlord shall be entitled to make such deductions as provided for in this Agreement. In the event this tenancy is a joint tenancy (i.e. there is more than one tenant) all tenants acknowledge that, for the purposes of the Deposit, the person first named on this Agreement will be the “lead tenant” for the purposes of the administration of the Deposit in terms of the rules of the tenancy deposit scheme. The tenants to this Agreement acknowledge that the lead tenant will be responsible for and control the repayment process, communication with the scheme and the dispute resolution mechanism, if applicable. The Tenant acknowledges that the Landlord accepts no liability for any actions or failings of the lead tenant in respect of the Deposit, and that any liability for any losses incurred as a result of the actions or failings of the lead tenant will attach to the lead tenant solely and not the Landlord or the Letting Agent. Where the Tenant owes the Landlord an amount greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover the difference from the Tenant.
